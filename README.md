# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

In this project, I have developed a deep learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The purpose is to assist healthcare professionals by providing an automated tool for early and accurate pneumonia diagnosis.

## Key Features

### Data Loading and Preprocessing:
- Medical imaging data handled by implementing processes such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.

### Model Training:
- Deep learning model using TensorFlow for binary classification (Pneumonia vs. Healthy).

## Dataset
This model is trained on publicly available chest X-ray datasets (Kaggle's Pneumonia Detection Dataset), containing labeled images categorized as "Pneumonia" or "Normal".

## Usage
To utilize the model:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. For now, it is intended for local testing only.
